      <p>
        I'm going back to 505
        If it's a seven hour flight
        Or a forty-five minute drive
        In my imagination
        You're waiting lying on your side
        With your hands between your thighs

        Stop and wait a sec
        When you look at me like that
        My darling, what did you expect?
        I'd probably still adore you
        With your hands around my neck
        Or I did last time I checked

        Not shy of a spark
        The knife twists at the thought
        That I should fall short of the mark
        Frightened by the bite
        Though it's no harsher than the bark
        A middle of adventure
        Such a perfect place to start

        I'm going back to 505
        If it's a seven hour flight
        Or a forty-five minute drive
        In my imagination
        You're waiting lying on your side
        With your hands between your thighs

        But I crumble completely when you cry
        It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
        I'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise
        Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

        I'm going back to 505
        If it's a seven hour flight
        Or a forty-five minute drive
        In my imagination
        You're waiting lying on your side
        With your hands between your thighs
        And a smile
      </p>
