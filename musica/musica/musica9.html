      <h2>Letra</h2>
        <p>
            Sure it's a calming notion, perpetual in motion
            But I don't need the comfort of any lies
            For I have seen the ending
            And there is no ascending rise

            Oh, back when I was younger
            Was told by other youngsters
            That my end will be torture
            Beneath the earth

            'Cause I don't see what they see
            When death is staring at me
            I see a window, a limit, to live it
            Or not at all

            If you could pull the lever
            To carry on forever
            Would your life even matter anymore?
            Sure it's a calming notion, perpetual in motion
            But it's not what you signed up for

            I'm sure there won't always be sunshine
            But there's this momentary beam of light
            You don't have to wait those salty decades
            To get through the gate
            It's all in front of your face

            I'm sure there won't always be sunshine
            I'm sure there won't always be sunshine
            But there's this momentary beam of light

            I could cross the ocean (I'm sure there won't always)
            In a fit of devotion (be sunshine)
            For every shining second (I'm sure there won't always)
            This fragile body beckons (be sunshine)

            You think you're owed it better (I'm sure there won't always)
            Believing ancient letters (be sunshine)
            Sure it's a calming notion (I'm sure there won't always be sunshine)
            But it's a lie
        </p>
