        Your blades are sharpened with precision (precision)
        Flashing your favorite point of view (point of view)
        I know you're waiting in the distance (distance)
        Just like you always do, just like you always do

        Already pulling me in
        Already under my skin
        And I know exactly how this ends, I

        Let you cut me open just to watch me bleed
        Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be
        Don't know why I'm hoping for what I won't receive
        Falling for the promise of the emptiness machine
        The emptiness machine

        Going around like a revolver (like a revolver)
        It's been decided how we lose (how we lose)
        'Cause there's a fire under the altar (the altar)
        I keep on lying to, I keep on lying to

        Already pulling me in
        Already under my skin
        And I know exactly how this ends, I

        Let you cut me open just to watch me bleed
        Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be
        Don't know why I'm hoping for what I won't receive
        Falling for the promise of the emptiness machine

        I only wanted to be part of something
        I only wanted to be part of, part of
        I only wanted to be part of something
        I only wanted to be part of, part of
        I only wanted to be part of something
        I only wanted to be part

        I let you cut me open just to watch me bleed
        Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be
        Don't know why I'm hoping, so fucking naive
        Falling for the promise of the emptiness machine
        The emptiness machine

        (I only wanted to be part of something) the emptiness machine, oh
        (I only wanted to be part of) the emptiness machine
      </p>
